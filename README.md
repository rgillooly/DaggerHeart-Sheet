## Instructions

This sheet is meant to be used on Roll20. As it does not yet allow for Daggerheart Character sheets, I have posted it here for you to use manually.

### 1. Make a ROll20 Game

Click CREATE NEW GAME

### 2. Select Custom

In The character sheet dropdown, search or find "Custom - Custom Character Sheet"

### 3. Clone Repo ZIP

You can make a zip file of this repository by clicking the green code button and selecting Download ZIP

### 4. Unzip ZIP

With a program like 7ZIP, or your native computer systems, you will need to extract the files somewhere, this is done by right clicking and navigating to something like "Exract All" or "Extract Here"

### 5. Copy and Paste HTML and CSS

There are two files in this repository that you will need, index.html and style.css, copy their contents

### 5a. Find the HTML and CSS tabs on Roll20

THere are two tabs that are necessary for the sheet ot work on Roll20, "HTML Layout" and "CSS Styling". They are found under "Game Settings" under the Settings dropdown for your game. (You must click the link to the game splash screen to see this, don't launch the game, just click its name)

### 6. Paste HTML and CSS

One at a time, as you can only have one thing on your clipboard (Which is where things go when you copy them) paste the html and css into the specified tabs. Then click save at the bottom.

## REMINDER: Save the code added or it won't work

## 7. Celebrate!

You have now added the sheet for your game, enjoy

## 8. Bug Report

If you find any bugs or unexpected behaviour, please report them on the github issues section. Please be as detailed as possible. Beat me over the head with details or I might not be able to figure out what the issue is.

## 9. Thank you

Thank you for using the sheet, and your patience!
